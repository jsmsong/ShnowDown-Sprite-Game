=====================

This project is an ongoing project, which is aimed at creating a 2D sprite-based Android platform game called ShnowDown!. This is an ongoing project, and is currently in the early pre-Alpha build stage.  ShnowDown! is a 2D sprite game created by Jesse Song and Elizabeth Sim, which follows the adventures of a snowman named Shnowy, who is the lone survivor of a dreadful disaster which killed all his entire species. Having being told that the disaster was caused by a group of evil anti-snow advocates, Shnowy races against time, jumping to and from various parts of the world to stop the bad people from successfully melting all the snow in the world!
